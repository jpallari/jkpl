{:title "Separate keyboard layout on Linux"
 :tags  ["howto"]}

<p>
I've been doing some pair programming where there are two sets of keyboards and mice connected to one computer.
I prefer using a different keyboard layout than what my coworkers use.
Fortunately, there is way to set a separate layout for each keyboard on Linux.
For this setup you need <code>xinput</code> and <code>setxkbmap</code> commands.
</p>

<p>
First, list all your input devices using command <code>xinput -list</code>. You should get a list that looks something like this:
</p>

<pre><code>⎡ Virtual core pointer                          id=2    [master pointer  (3)]
⎜   ↳ Virtual core XTEST pointer                id=4    [slave  pointer  (2)]
⎜   ↳ ETPS/2 Elantech Touchpad                  id=12   [slave  pointer  (2)]
⎜   ↳ Logitech USB Receiver                     id=14   [slave  pointer  (2)]
⎜   ↳ Logitech USB Receiver                     id=15   [slave  pointer  (2)]
⎣ Virtual core keyboard                         id=3    [master keyboard (2)]
    ↳ Virtual core XTEST keyboard               id=5    [slave  keyboard (3)]
    ↳ Power Button                              id=6    [slave  keyboard (3)]
    ↳ Video Bus                                 id=7    [slave  keyboard (3)]
    ↳ Sleep Button                              id=8    [slave  keyboard (3)]
    ↳ USB2.0 0.3M UVC WebCam                    id=9    [slave  keyboard (3)]
    ↳ Asus Laptop extra buttons                 id=10   [slave  keyboard (3)]
    ↳ AT Translated Set 2 keyboard              id=11   [slave  keyboard (3)]
    ↳ ACPI Virtual Keyboard Device              id=13   [slave  keyboard (3)]</code></pre>

<p>
Next, look for the keyboard that you wish to change the layout for.
In my example, I only have one keyboard device listed: AT Translated Set 2 keyboard.
The list also tells us the ID the device is assigned to, which is 11 in my case.
You need to pass the ID to the command <code>setxkbmap</code> using option <code>-device</code>.
For example, if I wanted to switch my keyboard layout to a finnish layout, the command would be:
</p>

<pre><code>setxkbmap -device 11 us</code></pre>
